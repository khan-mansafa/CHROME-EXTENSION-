📊 Productivity Tracker


The Productivity Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to monitor and analyze online activity by categorizing time into productive and unproductive segments. In today’s digital era, distractions are abundant, and managing time effectively is a challenge. This project addresses that challenge by providing users with detailed insights into their daily and weekly activities through an intuitive dashboard and interactive charts.

The application not only logs activity but also provides real-time visualizations that empower users to identify patterns, measure their focus levels, and improve productivity. With its start/stop tracking functionality, secure data handling, and clear reports, this tool is ideal for professionals, students, and anyone aiming to manage time more efficiently.

🚀 Features

✅ User Authentication – Secure login ensures individual data privacy.

✅ Real-Time Tracking – Logs productive vs unproductive website usage.

✅ Start/Stop Controls – Allows users to pause or resume activity tracking.

✅ Weekly Analytics Dashboard – Displays productivity data in line charts.

✅ Dynamic Graph Updates – Fetches fresh data every 30 seconds.

✅ Responsive UI – Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

✅ Clean Modern Design – Styled with Tailwind CSS for professional look.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend (Client-Side)

React.js – Core library for building the user interface.

React Hooks (useState, useEffect) – State and side-effect management.

Recharts – For rendering interactive and customizable productivity graphs.

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsiveness.

Backend (Server-Side)

Flask (Python) – Lightweight web framework handling APIs and data logic.

Flask REST API – Exposes endpoints for analytics and tracking.

Database

SQLite / PostgreSQL – Stores user logs, categorized activity, and time duration.

Development Tools

ESLint – Maintains clean and consistent code practices.

Chrome Extension (Tracking Script) – Captures website usage and sends logs to backend.

📊 How It Works

The Chrome extension script runs in the background and logs website activity.

Every 60 seconds, data such as website, duration, category, and date is sent to the Flask backend.

The backend processes and stores this information in the database.

The React dashboard fetches analytics data using API calls.

Recharts visualizes the data in line graphs, showing daily and weekly productivity trends.

📈 Data Visualization

The X-axis represents time or days of the week.

The Y-axis represents duration (in minutes).

Green line → Productive time.

Red line → Unproductive time.

Tooltips and legends enhance graph readability.

🎯 Conclusion

The Productivity Tracker is more than just a timer—it is a personalized analytics system for time management. By combining React, Flask, Recharts, and Tailwind CSS, the project delivers a smooth, modern, and functional tool for improving productivity. Whether for students keeping track of study habits or professionals monitoring work efficiency, this solution provides actionable insights for better digital discipline.
